== MCP Integration

The {tr_mcp} is an optional component that enables AI-assisted infrastructure management for your SAP landscape. It exposes {trento} functionality through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard that facilitates secure communication between data sources and AI agents. While the core {trserver} operates independently, the {tr_mcp} component allows you to integrate {trento} into an agentic AI workflow. This enables the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform common monitoring and troubleshooting tasks using natural language, providing a standardized way for AI tools to access real-time system state and best-practice validations.
