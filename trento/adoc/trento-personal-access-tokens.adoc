=== About Personal Access Tokens

Personal Access Tokens are an alternative to using username/password pairs for authentication to {trento} APIs and are intended to access resources on behalf of the token owner.

A Personal Access Token has the same capabilities to access resources and perform actions on those resources that the owner of the token has.

[NOTE]
====
If user permissions are changed or the user is deleted or locked, the capabilities of the Personal Access Tokens owned by that user are affected accordingly.

=== Creating a Personal Access Token

After logging in to {trento} Web UI, navigate to your profile by clicking on your username in the top right corner and selecting *Profile* from the dropdown menu.

=== Using a Personal Access Token

Once a Personal Access Token has been created, it can be used to authenticate API requests by including it in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -X GET "..." -H "Authorization: Bearer trento_pat_<rest_of_token>"
----

=== Deleting a Personal Access Token

A Personal Access Token can be deleted by clicking its contextual *Delete* button in the *Personal Access Tokens* section of the profile.
