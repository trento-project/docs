== Requirements
:revdate: 2025-10-31


This section describes requirements for the {trserver} and its {tragent}s.

[[sec-trento-server-requirements]]
=== {trserver} requirements

Running all the {trserver} components requires a minimum of 4 GB of RAM, two CPU cores and 64 GB of storage. When using K3s, such storage should be provided under `/var/lib/rancher/k3s`.

{trento} is based on event-driven technology. Registered events are stored in a {postgresql} database with a default retention period of 10 days. For each host registered with {trento}, you need to allocate at least 1.5GB of space in the {postgresql} database.

{trserver} supports different deployment scenarios: {k8s} and systemd. A {k8s}-based deployment of {trserver} is cloud-native and OS-agnostic. It can be performed on the following services:

* RKE2
* a {k8s} service in a cloud provider
* any other CNCF-certified {k8s} running on x86_64 architecture

A production-ready {k8s}-based deployment of {trserver} requires {k8s} knowledge. The Helm chart is intended to be used by customers without in-house {k8s} expertise, or as a way to try {trento} with a minimum of effort. However, Helm chart delivers a basic deployment of the {trserver} with all the components running on a single node of the cluster.

[[sec-sap-requirements]]
=== {sap} requirements

An {sap} system must run on a HANA database to be discovered by {trento}. In addition, the parameter `dbs/hdb/dbname` must be set in the DEFAULT profile of the {sap} system to the correct database (tenant) name.

The agent must be installed in the following locations:

* the host where the ASCS instance is running
* a host where an application server instance is running
* all the database hosts

[[sec-trento-agent-requirements]]
=== {tragent} requirements

The resource footprint of the {tragent} is designed to not impact the performance of the host it runs on.

The {tragent} component needs to interact with several low-level system components that are part of the {sles4sap} distribution.

The hosts must have unique machine identifiers (ids) in order to be registered in Trento. This means that if a host in your environment is built as a clone of another one, make sure to change the machine's identifier as part of the cloning process before starting the {tragent} on it.

Similarly, the clusters must have unique authkeys in order to be registered in {trento}.

=== {trento} MCP Server requirements (optional)

The {trento} MCP Server is an optional component that enables AI-assisted operations via the link:https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction[Model Context Protocol] (MCP). It exposes a single HTTP endpoint that MCP-compatible assistants can use to interact with {trento}.

The MCP Server is lightweight and stateless. No persistent storage required; allocate space for logs as per your logging policy.

[[sec-trento-network-requirements]]
=== Network requirements

* The Web component of the {trserver} must be reachable from any {tragent} host via HTTP (port TCP/80) or via HTTPS (port TCP/443) if SSL is enabled.
* The checks engine component of the {trserver} must be reachable from any {tragent} host via Advanced Message Queuing Protocol or AMQP (port TCP/5672).
* The Prometheus component of the {trserver}, if it exists, must be able to reach the Node Exporter in the {tragent} hosts.
* The {sap} Basis administrator must access to the Web component of the {trserver} via HTTP (port TCP/80) or via HTTPS (port TCP/443) if SSL is enabled.

==== MCP Server network requirements (optional)

Inbound to the MCP Server:

* TCP/5000 for the MCP endpoint (default, adjustable via `PORT`). The API is exposed under the path `/mcp`
  ** In {k8s}, expose via Ingress host/path as configured in the Helm chart
  ** On systemd/container deployments, ensure the firewall allows access on the chosen port
* Optional: TCP/8080 for health checks when enabled (`ENABLE_HEALTH_CHECK=true`; port adjustable via `HEALTH_PORT`)

Outbound from the MCP Server to {trserver}:

* If using `TRENTO_URL` (recommended): HTTPS to the externally reachable {trserver} URL (for example, behind NGINX)
* If using `OAS_PATH` (direct internal access): HTTP(S) to the Web and Wanda API endpoints (for example, `http://localhost:4000/api/all/openapi`, `http://localhost:4001/wanda/api/all/openapi`, or the corresponding service names in {k8s}/container networks)


[[sec-trento-installation-prerequisites]]
=== Installation prerequisites

* *{trserver}* For a {k8s}-based deployment, you must have access to {suse} public registry for the deployment of {trserver} containers. For a systemd deployment, you must have a registered {sles4sap} 15 (SP4 or higher) or {sles4sap} 16.0 distribution.
* *{tragent}s* A registered {sles4sap} 15 (SP3 or higher) distribution.
* *{trento} MCP Server* (optional): a running {trserver} (Web and Wanda components) reachable from the MCP Server, network connectivity from the MCP Server to the {trserver} API endpoints and a Personal Access Token (user-scoped) created in {trweb} to authenticate requests from MCP clients.
