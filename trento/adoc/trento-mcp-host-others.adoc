==== Integrating the {tr_mcp} with other clients
:revdate: 2025-11-25

The {tr_mcp} can be integrated with any client application that supports the Model Context Protocol. This allows interaction with the {trento} API and execute tools defined in the OpenAPI specification through your preferred AI assistant or development tool.

This guide uses Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot as the primary example, but the configuration patterns apply to any MCP-compatible host.

===== Prerequisites
	
To configure your client, ensure you have:

include::partials/mcp-host-prerequisites.adoc[]

===== Configuring Your Client

Once you have your {trserver} installation ready with the {tr_mcp} URL and API token, you can configure the MCP Server client. The examples below show JSON configuration format, which is used by most MCP Server clients, including VS Code, Claude Desktop, and others.


====== Option 1: Configuration with Prompted Input

This configuration prompts you for your personal access token when the client starts, keeping credentials secure and out of configuration files. The `password: true` setting ensures your personal access token input is masked when you type it.

[NOTE]
====
This option is supported by most clients, including VS Code. Check your client's documentation if the prompt feature is not available.
====

[source,json]

{
  "servers": {
    "trento": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "{https://trento.example.com/mcp-server-trento/mcp}",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "${input:trento-personal-access-token}"
      }
    }
  },
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "trento-personal-access-token",
      "description": "Trento API Key",
      "password": true
    }
  ]
}
----

====== Option 2: Direct Header Configuration

For clients that don't support prompted input, or for testing purposes, set your {trento} personal access token directly in the configuration file.

[WARNING]
====
When using this option, ensure your configuration file has appropriate permissions and is not committed to version control systems.
====
// if {tr_mcp_url_https} changes, update url too
[source,json]
----
{
  "servers": {
    "trento": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://trento.example.com/mcp-server-trento/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "trento-personal-access-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

[NOTE]
====
Replace `{tr_mcp_url_https}` with your actual {tr_mcp} endpoint URL from your installation.
