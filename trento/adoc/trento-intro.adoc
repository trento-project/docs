== What is {trento}?
:revdate: 2025-10-31


{trento} is the official version of the Trento community project. It is a comprehensive monitoring solution consisting of two main components: the {trserver} and the {tragent}. {trento} provides the following functionality and features:

* A user-friendly reactive Web interface for {sap} Basis administrators.
* Automated discovery of {pace} clusters using SAPHanaSR classic or angi as well as different fencing mechanisms, including diskless SBD.
* Automated discovery of {sap} systems running on ABAP or JAVA stacks and HANA databases.
* Awareness of maintenance situations in a {pace} cluster at cluster, node, or resource level.
* Configuration validation for {hana} Scale-Up Performance/Cost-optimized, {hana} Scale-out and ASCS/ERS clusters deployed on Azure, AWS, GCP or on-premises bare metal platforms, including KVM and Nutanix.
* Useful information that offers insights about the execution of configuration checks.
* Delivery of configuration checks decoupled from core functionality.
* Email alerting for critical events in the monitored landscape.
* Integration of saptune into the console and specific configuration checks at host and cluster levels.
* Information about relevant patches and upgradable packages for registered hosts via integration with {smlm}.
* Monitoring of CPU and memory usage at the host level through basic integration with {prometheus}.
* API-based architecture to facilitate integration with other monitoring tools.
* Rotating API key to protect communication from the {tragent} to the {trserver}.
* Housekeeping capabilities.

The *{trserver}* is an independent, distributed system designed to run on a {k8s} cluster or as a regular systemd stack. The {trserver} provides a Web front-end for user interaction. The {trserver} consists of the following components:

* The web component that acts as a control plane responsible for internal and external communications as well as rendering the UI.
* The checks engine named wanda that orchestrates the execution of configuration checks.
* A {postgresql} database for data persistence.
* The RabbitMQ message broker for communicating between the checks engine and the agents.
* A {prometheus} instance that retrieves the metrics collected by the {prometheus} node exporter in the registered hosts.

The *{tragent}* is a single background process (`trento-agent`) running on each monitored host of the SAP infrastructure.

=== AI-Assisted Operations with the {trento} MCP Server (optional)

The {trento} MCP Server extends {trento} with AI-assisted operations by implementing the open link:https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction[Model Context Protocol] (MCP). It enables MCP-compatible AI assistants—such as public AI tools like link:https://code.visualstudio.com/[VS Code] with link:https://github.com/features/copilot[GitHub Copilot], link:https://claude.ai/download[Claude Desktop], or link:https://cursor.sh/[Cursor], or private AI platforms like link:https://www.suse.com/products/ai/[{suseai}]—to securely connect to {trento} and execute common monitoring and troubleshooting tasks using natural language.

With the {trento} MCP Server, you can:

* Ask conversational questions such as "What's the overall health of my SAP environment?" or "Show me all SAP systems with critical status."
* Retrieve cluster and host details on demand (for example, "Show configuration for cluster C1" or "List hosts running HANA").
* Review checks and execution history to understand configuration drifts or failures.
* Surface critical alerts that need immediate attention.

==== What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

link:https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction[Model Context Protocol] (MCP) is an open standard that allows AI applications to securely connect to external tools and data sources. In the context of {trento}, MCP provides a consistent, secure way for assistants to call {trserver} APIs without manual navigation of the web UI.

==== How the MCP Server fits into {trento}

* It runs alongside the {trserver} (as part of your deployment) and exposes a single HTTP endpoint (path `/mcp`).
* It automatically discovers the {trserver} APIs and generates MCP tools from the OpenAPI specifications exposed by {trweb} and Wanda.
* It authenticates to {trserver} using user-scoped Personal Access Tokens (API keys) and forwards requests securely.
* It's an optional component—{trento} works without it—but unlocks natural-language workflows when enabled.

These clients can be pointed to the MCP endpoint URL and supplied with the appropriate API key header to authenticate against your {trserver}.

==== Using the MCP Server

To get started with the {trento} MCP Server, you need to:

1. Ensure the MCP Server is deployed and running alongside your {trserver}. Refer to the installation guide for details.

2. Configure your MCP-compatible AI assistant to connect to the MCP endpoint.

3. Provide a valid Personal Access Token (API key) for authentication.

Once connected, you can interact with {trento} using natural language commands, such as asking for system health, cluster details, or check results.
