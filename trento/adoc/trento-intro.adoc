== What is {trento}?
:revdate: 2025-11-12


{trento} is the official version of the Trento community project. It is a comprehensive monitoring solution consisting of two main components: the {trserver} and the {tragent}. {trento} provides the following functionality and features:

* A user-friendly reactive Web interface for {sap} Basis administrators.
* Automated discovery of {pace} clusters using SAPHanaSR classic or angi as well as different fencing mechanisms, including diskless SBD.
* Automated discovery of {sap} systems running on ABAP or JAVA stacks and HANA databases.
* Awareness of maintenance situations in a {pace} cluster at cluster, node, or resource level.
* Configuration validation for {hana} Scale-Up Performance/Cost-optimized, {hana} Scale-out and ASCS/ERS clusters deployed on Azure, AWS, GCP or on-premises bare metal platforms, including KVM and Nutanix.
* Useful information that offers insights about the execution of configuration checks.
* Delivery of configuration checks decoupled from core functionality.
* Email alerting for critical events in the monitored landscape.
* Integration of saptune into the console and specific configuration checks at host and cluster levels.
* Information about relevant patches and upgradable packages for registered hosts via integration with {smlm}.
* Monitoring of CPU and memory usage at the host level through basic integration with {prometheus}.
* API-based architecture to facilitate integration with other monitoring tools.
* Rotating API key to protect communication from the {tragent} to the {trserver}.
* Optional AI-assisted operations to enable natural-language interaction with {trserver}.
* Housekeeping capabilities.


=== Trento Architecture

=== {trserver}

The {trserver} is an independent, distributed system designed to run on a {k8s} cluster or as a regular systemd stack. It provides both a Web front-end for user interaction and backend APIs for automation and integration with components such as the {tr_mcp}. Together with the optional link:https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro[{tr_mcp}], it enables secure, AI-assisted operations by exposing {trserver} APIs for natural-language interactions with tools like Copilot, Claude, and {suseai}.

The {trserver} consists of the following components:

* The {web} component that acts as a control plane responsible for internal and external communications as well as rendering the UI.
* The checks engine named {wanda} that orchestrates the execution of configuration checks.
* The {tr_mcp} which provides a secure way to call {trserver} APIs without manual navigation of the web UI.
* A {postgresql} database for data persistence.
* The {rabbitmq} message broker for communicating between the checks engine and the agents.
* A {prometheus} instance that retrieves the metrics collected by the {prometheus} node exporter in the registered hosts. This {prometheus} instance is optional in a systemd deployment.

=== {tragent}

The *{tragent}* is a single background process (`trento-agent`) running on each monitored host of the SAP infrastructure.


// === {trento-mcp}
// 
// The {trento-mcp} extends {trento} with AI-assisted operations by implementing the open link:https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction[Model Context Protocol] (MCP),which is an open standard that allows AI applications to securely connect to external tools and data sources. In the context of {trento}, MCP provides a consistent, secure way for assistants to call {trserver} APIs without manual navigation of the web UI.
// 
// {trento} MCP Server, enables to:
// 
// * Ask conversational questions such as "What's the overall health of my SAP environment?" or "Show me all SAP systems with critical status."
// * Retrieve cluster and host details on demand (for example, "Show configuration for cluster C1" or "List hosts running HANA").
// * Review checks and execution history to understand configuration drifts or failures.
// * Surface critical alerts that need immediate attention.
// 
// It enables MCP-compatible AI assistants—such as public AI tools like:
// 
// * link:https://code.visualstudio.com/[VS Code] with link:https://github.com/features/copilot[GitHub Copilot]
// * link:https://claude.ai/download[Claude Desktop]
// * link:https://cursor.sh/[Cursor]
// * Private AI platforms like link:https://www.suse.com/products/ai/[{suseai}], to securely connect to {trento}.
// 
// ==== How the MCP Server fits into {trento}
// 
// * It runs alongside the {trserver} (as part of your deployment) and exposes a single HTTP endpoint (path `/mcp`).
// * It automatically discovers the {trserver} APIs and generates MCP tools from the OpenAPI specifications exposed by {tr_web} and Wanda.
// * It authenticates to {trserver} using user-scoped Personal Access Tokens (API keys) and forwards requests securely.
// * It's an optional component—{trento} works without it—but unlocks natural-language workflows when enabled.
// 
// These clients can be pointed to the MCP endpoint URL and supplied with the appropriate API key header to authenticate against your {trserver}.
// 
// ==== Using the MCP Server
// 
// To get started with the {trento} MCP Server, you need to:
// 
// 1. Ensure the MCP Server is deployed and running alongside your {trserver}. Refer to the installation guide for details.
// 
// 2. Configure your MCP-compatible AI assistant to connect to the MCP endpoint.
// 
// 3. Provide a valid Personal Access Token (API key) for authentication.
// 
// Once connected, you can interact with {trento} using natural language commands, such as asking for system health, cluster details, or check results.
//
