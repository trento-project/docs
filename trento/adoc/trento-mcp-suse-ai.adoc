==== Integrating the {tr_mcp} with {suseai}

This guide explains how to integrate the {tr_mcp} with {suseai}, including configuration and deployment instructions.

===== Getting Started with {suseai}

{suseai} is a platform that allows you to deploy and manage AI models and applications in a {kube} environment. It provides tools for model management, deployment, and integration with various AI frameworks.

Refer to the official https://documentation.suse.com/suse-ai/1.0/[{suseai} documentation] for detailed information. Always refer to the latest instructions in the https://documentation.suse.com/suse-ai/1.0/html/AI-deployment-intro/index.html[{suseai} deployment guide] for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
To run the entire stack, you can also use the https://github.com/SUSE/suse-ai-deployer[{suseai} Deployer {helm} chart].

===== Install {owui}

Refer to the official https://documentation.suse.com/suse-ai/1.0/html/openwebui-using/index.html[{owui} documentation]

===== Deploying the {tr_mcp}

To deploy the {tr_mcp} in your {suseai} cluster, install it via the {trento} Server {helm} chart. Follow the step-by-step instructions in <<sec-trento-mcp-server-k8s>>. The {tr_mcp} is packaged as a sub-chart and can be enabled during the {trento} Server installation.

For chart sources and values, see the link:https://github.com/trento-project/helm-charts[{trento} helm-charts repository].

===== Add {tr_mcp} to {owui}

{owui} includes native support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). With this integration, {owui} connects to MCP servers from the backend, allowing you to safely use an internal {kube} Service DNS name without exposing the service publicly.

======  Created a Personal Access Token

** Log in to your {trento} web interface with your username and password.
** Click on your username in the top-right corner and select *Profile*.
** Scroll down to the *Personal Access Tokens* section.
** Click the *Generate Token* button.
** Enter a descriptive name for the token (e.g., "MCP Client").
** Optionally configure an expiration date for the token, or select *Never Expires*.
** Click *Generate Token*.
** *Important:* Copy the generated token immediately and store it securely — it will not be shown again.

====== Enable {tr_mcp} in {owui}

[arabic]
. Open *Admin Settings* and go to *External Tools*.
. Click *Add Server*.
. Set *Type* to `MCP (Streamable HTTP)`.
. Enter your Server URL and authentication details:
.. *Server URL* (example): `http://trento-server-mcp-server.suse-ai.svc.cluster.local:5000/mcp`
.. *Auth*: `<TOKEN>` (the token you generated in the {trento} console)
. Click *Save*.

===== Enable the {tr_mcp} for a Model

[arabic]
. Go to *Models*, select *Manage Models*, and open your target model.
. In the *Tools* or *MCP Servers* section, enable/select `{tr_mcp}` for this model. This makes the {trento} tools available to any user of that model in {owui}.
. Verify the integration:
.. Start a new chat with the enabled model
.. Confirm that tools from `{tr_mcp}` are available and can be invoked (for example, try listing SAP systems)

The AI model will use the {tr_mcp} tools to query your {trento} installation and provide detailed, contextual responses about your SAP infrastructure.
