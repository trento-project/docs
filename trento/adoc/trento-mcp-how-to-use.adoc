=== Using the {tr_mcp}

The {tr_mcp} provides the interface for AI-assisted infrastructure operations, enabling agentic assistants to integrate with {trento}. By utilizing the Model Context Protocol, these assistants can perform monitoring and troubleshooting tasks through natural language. See <<sec-trento-mcp-sles,{mcp_host} on SLES>> or <<sec-trento-mcp-others,Using alternative {mcp_host} clients>> for details.
