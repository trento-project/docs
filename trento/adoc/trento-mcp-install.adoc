=== Installing {tr_mcp}

The {tr_mcp} can be deployed in several ways depending on your infrastructure and requirements.

Supported installation methods: 

* <<sec-trento-mcp-server-k8s,{k8s} deployment>>
* <<sec-trento-mcp-server-systemd, systemd MCP deployment >>

==== Prerequisites {tr_mcp}

The MCP Server is lightweight and stateless. No persistent storage required; allocate space for logs as per your logging policy. Before installing the {tr_mcp}, both {tr_web} and {tr_wanda} components must be running and be accessible for the {tr_mcp} to function properly.

* There must be network connectivity between the {tr_mcp} and {trserver} components.
* Access to the {trserver} URL (important when deployed behind {nginx}, or any other proxy) must be possible.
