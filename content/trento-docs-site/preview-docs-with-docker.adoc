== Local Documentation Preview with Docker

Easy way to locally preview documentation changes without installing repository dependencies (like Node.js or Antora) on your host machine.

=== Prerequisites

* Docker Engine (or Podman).
* Docker Compose.

=== Workflow

. **Start the Preview**
+
To start the build process inside a container, navigate to the root directory of the repository and run the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker compose up
----
+

. **Check the Docs**
+
Once the build is complete and the server starts, open your browser and navigate to:
+
http://localhost:3000

. **Review and Rebuild**
+
The container builds the site and serves it. To view new changes:
+
* Stop the container (press `Ctrl+C`).
* Make your changes to the source files.
* Run `docker compose up` again.
+
The container will rebuild the documentation with your new changes for preview.
