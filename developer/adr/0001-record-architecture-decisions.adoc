== 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2022-07-27

=== Status

Accepted

=== Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

=== Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as
http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions[described
by Michael Nygard]. We will add to the standard template a "`Considered
Options`" paragraph when to track the alternatives we considered in the
decision-making process.

=== Consequences

See Michael Nygard’s article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR
toolset, see Nat Pryce’s https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools[adr-tools].
