# Coding standards and best practices

## Pull requests

- Organize your work in small, self-contained, and well-documented commits.
- Rewrite your branch history to make it easy to review your changes. This
  includes squashing fixup commits, rebasing on top of the latest master, and
  rewriting commits to make them self-contained.
- Use [git absorb](https://github.com/tummychow/git-absorb) to automatically create and squash fixup commits.
- Use the [squash and merge](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits) option to merge your PR.
