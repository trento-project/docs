# Trento Architecture

Here's a high level view of what we do to achieve the result of providing a reactive event driven system.

## Discovery
[Trento Agent](https://github.com/trento-project/agent) extracts relevant information on the target infrastructure and publishes those to the control plane.  
_(cluster discoveries, host discoveries, cloud discoveries...)_

The control plane Discovery integration securely accepts published discoveries, stores them and triggers Scenario Detection.

---

## Scenario Detection
The [control plane](https://github.com/trento-project/web) discovery integration leverages specific policies to determine the scenario to be triggered based on the discovered information.

That means we need to be able to determine which command to dispatch in the application.
_(RegisterHost, RegisterDatabaseInstance and so forth...)_

---

## Business rule validation
The detected scenario dispatches the needed command(s) which trigger validation of the requested action(s) against the current state and the proper business rules for the usecase.

---

## Events & State change
Going through the previous steps of dispatching and action in the system and applying business rules to the process, translates in things actually happening (or not) and changing some state (or not).

When things happen we represent them as **events**  (_SAPSystemHealthChanged, ChecksExecutioncompleted_), we store them in an append only **Event Store** and use them as the source of truth of the system (or part of it).

See Event Sourcing [here](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)

## State Propagation & Reaction
Once things happen the system notifies the world about it by emitting the recorded events so that interested components can listen for those and react accordingly.

Reaction may be any orthogonal listener responsible to deliver part of the feature being served.

Some of possible _reactions_
- projecting read optimized models for specific usecases (_Clusters, Hosts, Heartbeats_) maybe later served via APIs
- Sending and email _whenever a SAP System's health goes critical_
- Broadcasting changes to the Reactive UI via websockets
- Third party software integration
- ...

## Checks Execution
The Checks Execution is managed by the [Checks Engine](https://github.com/trento-project/wanda). It uses the [Trento configuration checks catalog](https://github.com/trento-project/checks), which consists of `yaml` files. Each check includes a script written in [Rhai](https://rhai.rs/) which is what the check tries to evaluate with some facts coming from the targets.

This component is responsible of:
- Listening for checks execution requests coming from the control plane (or any other external user)
- Sending the fact gathering requests to the appropriate targets
- Evaluating check results using the gathered facts
- Publishing the evaluated results
- Storing and exposing the executed executions

## General Considerations
[CQRS with Commanded](https://github.com/commanded/commanded) supports complex domain modeling, however, whenever possible we use simpler implementations for non-critical aspects (_Tagging_ for instance, is a basic CRUD operation).
