== 17. Agent Operations Framework

Date: 2025-01-27

=== Status

Accepted

=== Context

Following the new epics and product decisions, we need to build a
framework capable of executing write operations on SAP machines. To
achieve this, we have decided to use the agent, as it runs on the
machines with root privileges, has all the necessary permissions to
execute commands, and includes infrastructure to consume messages from
other components of Trento.

=== Decision

Unlike fact-gathering operations, we have chosen to delegate this new
development to a dedicated library rather than embedding the code
directly into the agent’s codebase. This approach ensures better
separation of concerns and allows the release of additional tools
supporting operations without affecting the agent’s codebase.

The requirements for this new development are very specific:

* Operations must be atomic and include rollback capabilities.
* Operations must accept arguments to enable actions in different
contexts without requiring dedicated code for each case.
* Operations must be transactional, including distinct steps for
prerequisites verification, commit, rollback, and validation of changes
applied during the commit phase.
* Operations must be versioned, with backward compatibility ensured for
previous versions in the event of updates.
* Operations must be idempotent.

The agent will consume the library containing these operations and use
it to fulfill operation requests from other components.

The library handling operations is named
https://github.com/trento-project/workbench[workbench].

==== Example:

* *Operator*: `+saptuneapplysolution+` - Applies a SAP Tune solution
using the solution name as an argument.
* *Operation*: Apply a SAP Tune solution if it has not already been
applied. If already applied, no action is taken. In case of an error,
revert the solution specified as an argument.

=== Operator

An operator is a unit of code capable of performing write operations on
target machines. A write operation can either succeed or fail. Upon
success, it generates a diff showing changes made during the commit
phase.

The operator accepts arguments in the form of a `+map[string]any+` to
specify operation parameters. Each operator is responsible for
extracting and validating these arguments.

The operator follows a transactional workflow, which includes the
following distinct phases:

* *PLAN*
* *COMMIT*
* *VERIFY*
* *ROLLBACK*

==== PLAN

The PLAN phase collects information about the operation and verifies
prerequisites. This phase also gathers information for generating diffs
by collecting the "`before`" state of the system. Backups are created
for any resources modified during the COMMIT phase, ensuring restoration
is possible in case of rollback or manual recovery if rollback fails.

If an error occurs during the PLAN phase, no rollback is required; the
operation is simply aborted.

==== COMMIT

The COMMIT phase performs the actual write operations using the data
collected during the PLAN phase. If an error occurs, rollback is
triggered.

The COMMIT phase must be idempotent. If a requested change has already
been applied, the commit operation is skipped without error. Idempotency
must be implemented based on the specific operation’s requirements.

==== VERIFY

The VERIFY phase ensures the actions applied during the COMMIT phase
produced the expected results. If an error occurs, rollback is
initiated.

The VERIFY phase also collects the "`after`" state to generate the diff
showing changes applied during the commit.

==== ROLLBACK

The ROLLBACK phase reverts changes made during the COMMIT phase. It uses
data collected during the PLAN phase to restore the system to its
previous state.

Rollback implementations may vary based on the type of operation. Clear
error messages and appropriate logs must be provided.

If rollback fails, an error is returned without further action.

Each operator implements these phases by satisfying the `+phaser+`
interface:

[source,go]
----
type phaser interface {
    plan(ctx context.Context) error
    commit(ctx context.Context) error
    rollback(ctx context.Context) error
    verify(ctx context.Context) error
    operationDiff(ctx context.Context) map[string]any
}
----

These methods are invoked by the Executor, which wraps the operator. All
operators are exposed through a constructor function, returning
operators already wrapped in an Executor.

=== Executor

The Executor is a wrapper around an operator that manages operations
transactionally. For library users, the Executor is transparent to the
users, operators are already wrapped within an Executor.

Below is a flowchart illustrating the transactional flow:

=== Registry

The Registry manages all available operators. Each operator has a
version. By default, the latest version is fetched if no specific
version is requested.

The operator naming convention is: `+<operatorname>@<version>+`

The Registry returns an Operator Builder:

[source,golang]
----
type OperatorBuilder func(operationID string, arguments OperatorArguments) Operator
----

* `+operationID+`: A unique identifier for the operation.
* `+arguments+`: A `+map[string]any+` structure containing operation
parameters.

=== Consequences

This development will enable transactional write operations on target
machines.

Each operation is atomic. Coordination, ordering, and dependency
management of multiple operations are not the agent’s responsibility but
are delegated to another component that orchestrates their execution.
